Weather and Alternate Landing Destination evalutation

This script creates a GUI that evaluates the Landing Destination weather in a certain datetime by decoded TAF. Also, it evaluates alternate destination airports according to their TAF.

Decoded TAFs are requested via https://www.checkwxapi.com/ API.

Necessary files are put in the add_files folder.
